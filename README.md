            <li>Increase Fleet During Peak Hours: Since the evening has the highest number of rentals, ensure that more bikes are available during these hours to meet the demand. 
                Consider deploying additional bikes or ensuring rapid turnaround times for bikes returned earlier in the day. 🚴‍♂️</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Weekend Promotions for Casual Users:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Target Weekend Casual Users: Since casual users rent more bikes on weekends, implement targeted marketing campaigns or promotions for weekends. 
                Discounts or loyalty programs could further boost weekend rentals. 🎊</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Seasonal Adjustments:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare for Winter: Given the lower rental rates in winter (January, February, March), consider offering special promotions or services 
                (e.g., heated seats or weather-resistant bikes) to encourage usage during these months. ❄️</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Expand Capacity:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Scale Up Operations: The significant increase in bike rentals from 2011 to 2012 indicates growing popularity. 
                Plan for continuous expansion of the fleet and infrastructure to meet the rising demand and avoid shortages. 📈</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Weather-Related Strategies:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve Weather Readiness: Since clear weather (type 1) sees the highest rentals, and misty weather (type 2) also maintains moderate rentals, 
                ensure bikes are well-maintained and ready for diverse weather conditions. Provide users with real-time weather updates and safety tips through the app. 🌦️</li>

    </li>
    <li><strong>Enhance Working Day Utilization:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Corporate Partnerships: Since more bikes are rented on working days, collaborate with companies to offer bike-sharing as a part of corporate wellness programs 
                or provide dedicated bikes for office commutes. 💼</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Holiday Specials:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-Holiday Incentives: To address the lower rentals on holidays, introduce special holiday promotions or events to encourage usage. 
                Highlight the benefits of biking for leisure during holidays. 🎉</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Seasonal Promotions:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Leverage Seasonal Popularity: Since fall (type 3) has the highest rentals, followed by summer (type 2) and winter (type 4), 
                plan seasonal campaigns that promote biking in these favorable seasons. Introduce seasonal passes or packages to attract consistent usage. 🍂☀️❄️</li>
